            <h2 class="mp">Causes of Climate Change</h2>
            <p class="pb">Climate change is <i><b>"a change in global or regional climate patterns"</b></i>. It was caused by many things. To the right is a diagram on how climate change exactly works. There is something called the <i><b>"Greenhouse Effect"</b></i>and it is when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth. Some of these gases are: carbon dioxide, methane, and chlorofluorocarbon!</p>

            <h2 class="mp">Effects of Climate Change</h2>
            <p class="pb">Climate change has caused many things. In the image to the left, you can see just a few of the things it has caused. Temperatures will continue to rise if we do not fix this problem, and changes in percipitation patterns will happen. We all know that there have been many hurricanes, including Maria, Irma, Harvey, Sandy, Katrina, and Andrew. These hurricanes were already bad and caused massive destruction, but they will gradually become for destructive and more frquent. There are so much more effects of climate change, and future effects. We need to do somethign to fix this problem!</p>

            <h2 class="mp">How To Help...</h2>
            <p class="pb">We can do many things to help this problem. The thing is we expect others to do it and when everyone thinks that, nothing will change. You can reduse and reuse before you cycle, volunteer at a cleanup, and even use public transportation instead of car! There is so much more to do and all you have to do is look around you to see what you can do to help!</p>
